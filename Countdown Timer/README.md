# Countdown Timer

This simple application allows the user to keep time by using preset timer buttons or by creating their own through inputting a total amount of time in minutes. Each preset button corresponds to a different chunk of time, being 20 seconds, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, and 60 minutes. Something important to note is clicking a different timer button will reset the already established countdown timer (ex. Clicking 20 minutes after 5 minutes was already clicked will push the total time left to the new amount, even after the 5-minute timer had already ran for a certain amount of time).

This project was particularly interesting due to discovering how to handle multiple options for countdown amounts and ensure that there was no overlap when more than one button was clicked successively. What was also rewarding was working with "this" properties to allow for user input should they want to create their own timer.
