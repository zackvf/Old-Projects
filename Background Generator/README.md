# CSS Background Generator

This very simple application lets the user create their own background by clicking inside of the two color picker boxes below the page's title. Once even one color is chosen, the linear gradient values will be displayed below the color picker boxes, so that the user can take those values and apply them to their own projects. This functionality is achieved by HTML "input" elements with the "color" attribute and an event listener for each of them, the combination of which set the page body's background.

This project was enjoyable to create primarily because of how simple it is in practice, while also being functional enough to be reusable in real-world scenarios. I gained valuable experience with adjusting CSS and manipulating DOM elements with basic JavaScript, skills that have been serving me well to this day.
