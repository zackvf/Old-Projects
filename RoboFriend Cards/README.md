# Robo-Friends React Application

This React application allows the user to search through a collection of "Robo-Friends" cards, each with a different name and character portrait attached to them. Once certain letters are typed into the input box, the collection of cards will reduce until only those that match the user's input remain.

This project was my first with the React library and it was enthralling because of how simplistic and yet interconnected it was overall. From managing "this" properties to destructuring variables and gaining valuable, practical experience with manipulating JSON, I was able to find a new appreciation for tools outside of the typical HTML/CSS/JavaScript. What I found most interesting was controlling "state," a concept I'd read about previously but never worked with first-hand, and through which I experienced several unexpected but welcome "Aha!" moments.
