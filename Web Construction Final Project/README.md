# Web Construction Final Project

This responsive website is the project that I created for my Web Construction course's final project assignment, where we were only required to build a website that demonstrates a few basic features, such as alternate pages to the home page like a gallery and a contact information page as well as an accordion-style dropdown list in an FAQ page. I took it upon myself to go beyond the requirements and test my level of ability at the time that I put this site together, including extra features like the CSS-based hover effects in the images gallery and a more stylized contact information section with emoticons and links to their associated destinations. This project was a great way to get my feet wet in web development and I'm quite proud of how it came out, as well as how far I'm come since then!
