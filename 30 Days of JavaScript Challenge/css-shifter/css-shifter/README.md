# CSS Paddle Shifters

This very simple application demonstrates basic functionality with altering the property values of an example object. The paddle shifters at the top of the page grant the user the ability to adjust the object as they see fit, changing the values for padding around the image, blurring the image, and the background color of the padding.

This project helped me to understand how to manipulate ```:root``` elements with CSS and the way they interact with "this" properties with JavaScript.
