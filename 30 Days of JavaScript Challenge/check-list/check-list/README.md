# To-Do Check List

This very simple application allows users to check off either one or multiple items at once inside of a list of items. In order to perform the latter function, the user only needs click on one item to check it off of the list, hold down the SHIFT key, and then click another item farther down, checking off all of the items inbetween the first and last ones clicked. The user can also check off all of the list items at once by holding SHIFT and clicking just the first item.

What I took away from this project was one way to check for certain events being present (such as a keyboard key being pressed) and looping through items in a node list with ```.forEach()``` to apply a CSS class to them, as long as the event's state evaluates to true.
