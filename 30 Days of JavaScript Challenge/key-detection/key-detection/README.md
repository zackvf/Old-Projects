# Secret Code/Keystroke Detection

This simple game gives the user the ability to start typing on their keyboard as soon as the page loads. If the user types the correct sequence of keys, a visual reward token will be displayed somewhere on the page at random. If the user clicks out of the page to do something else, they only need to click back onto it to begin typing again. For testing purposes, the secret code is "van" without the quotation marks.

This exercise gave me a better understanding of how keystroke values are stored in arrays and managed with methods like ```.splice()``` and ```.join()``` to allow for functional usability.
