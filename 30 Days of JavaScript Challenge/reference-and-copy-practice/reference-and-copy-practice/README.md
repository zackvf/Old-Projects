# Practice with Referencing and Copying

These exercises helped me to better understand the difference between copying and referencing variables, array values, and object properties. The point I found to be most noteworthy is that without using methods like ```.slice()``` or ```.concat()``` to create a true copy of an array, altering some value of a created reference to the original array actually updates the original array as well, proving the importance of comprehending how to copy/reference properly.
