    // team[3] = 'Lucy';
    /* The reference created by the team variable updates the original array */

    // Copy method 1 - call slice against the original array to make a simple copy, instead of slicing specific values in the array itself
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);

    // Copy method 2 - create a new, blank array and concatenate original array into it
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // Copy method 3 - ES6 Spread and Array.from options

    // Incorrect copy method

    // This will affect the reference to the original object
    const dev = Object.assign({}, van);

    // Parsing a JSON string works well enough as a cloneDeep alternative, such that the given object is turned into a string and immediately changed back into an object, shaking previous references to make a functional pseudo-copy
