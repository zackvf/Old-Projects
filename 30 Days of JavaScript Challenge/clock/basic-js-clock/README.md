# Basic JavaScript Clock

This very simple application displays an analog-style clock and applies the user's local time to it to provide an accurate representation of their current time.

As fairly straightforward as this project was to complete I was still able to practice a valuable skill in the ```transform``` method, which served to take the timing calculations made and convert them into a degrees amount for usage by the clock hands.
