# Whack-A-Mole Game

This application provides a "whack-a-mole" experience similar to that of the classic arcade game. To play, the user simply has to click the "Start" button at the side of the screen and, for the 10-second duration of the game, click on as many moles as they can. The moles pop up at random locations of dirt, as well in random intervals of time, so to set a record among their friends the user must be quick-handed. The user's total score is displayed throughout their gaming experience.

This project at first seemed complicated but was made clear as I progressed. Eventually I came to see that the inner workings of the game, primarily the randomness of the moles' appearances, relies on fairly simple mathematical calculations and applying the necessary CSS classes to the holes to display the moles while removing them if they were properly clicked.
