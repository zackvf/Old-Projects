# Mouse Movement Shadow Effects

This simplistic exercise exhibits the power of adjusting several differing variables at once, all within a single method and event listener. To create the shadow effects on the page's text, the user only has to move their cursor around/through the area of the text. To accomplish this functionality, a ```shadow()``` method is called on the ```mousemove``` event which offsets the width/height variables and x/y page coordinates of an ```h1``` element accordingly to match the cursor's movement away from and towards the text, generating multiple shadows in varying distances from each other and their origin.

This project gave me valuable practice with mathmematic equations in JavaScript and understanding the way they can be applied to basic events and functions to create something unique.
