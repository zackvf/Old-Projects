# Drum Kit with JavaScript

This simple application allows the user to play drum sound effects by pressing the displayed keys corresponding to the ones on their keyboard. In order to achieve this, a ```.play()``` method is called on each of the elements and adds/removes a class to highlight the current key being pressed, granting enhanced feedback for a more entertaining UX.
