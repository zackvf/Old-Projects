# Video Player Application

This application displays a basic video player and allows the user to command the functions of the video player itself, being the speed at which it plays back, the volume of the video, and the option to skip ahead in time by 25 seconds or jump back by 10 seconds. The tracking bar can also be used to skip around the entire length of the video.

This project taught me a good deal about how video players in general handle functions that require combining visual aspects with timing and number conversions. While I had already assumed there would be a number of event listeners for the buttons that would be clicked and the scrubbing of the time-length tracking bar, it was particularly interesting to utilize "this" properties and ```parseFloat``` in such a way that DOM element attributes could be picked on to be used in mathematical calculations, instead of in a more abstract approach to functionality.
