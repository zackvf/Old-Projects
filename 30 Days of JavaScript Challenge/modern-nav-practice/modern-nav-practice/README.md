# Practice with Modern Navigation

This exercise demonstrates one way to achieve the effect of a "follow-along" highlighter for links on a page. As a precursor to my modern dropdown navigation project, I was able to gain an understanding of the workings of ```getBoundingClientRect()``` in utilizing the coordinates obtained from that method in conjunction with ```window``` properties.
