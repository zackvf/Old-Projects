# Practice with Basic Sorting

This very simple exercise helped me better comprehend how to sort list items by the desired name of the items, such as band names, without the interference of articles such as 'the', 'an', or 'a'. This sorting functionality is achieved by replacing those articles with a blank space at the head of the band name, trimming that space, and comparing two names with each other, alphabetizing each one with a 1 or -1. Then the names are joined to account for the commas separating them in their original list/array.
