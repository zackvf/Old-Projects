# Text-to-Speech Application

This application allows the user to type out a desired message and command the browser to speak it outloud to them, while also controlling the pitch of the voice and the speed at which the message is read. The user additionally has the option to change the type of voice that reads the message from a dropdown list above the controls. This application's functionality is accomplished through the utilization of the ```SpeechSynthesisUtterance``` web speech API, granting the rate/pitch controls.

This project was particularly fun to create as speech synthesis was a new technology for me to work with, where I was able to gain more of an understanding of how web APIs interact with fairly typical DOM elements such as text fields and buttons.
