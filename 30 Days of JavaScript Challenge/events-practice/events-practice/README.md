# Practice with Events

This simple exercise granted me a better understanding of "bubbling" and "capturing," such that capturing can be described as the reverse process of bubbling and both events provide valuable information on user interaction with DOM elements. This is especially so if there are many complex objects on a site and a firm grasp on which elements will react to input, compared to others at any given moment, is required of the developer.
