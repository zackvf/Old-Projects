# Video Playback Speed Controller

This project expands on the idea of the ability to control the playback rate of a video. To accomplish this, a stylized sidebar next to the video is displayed at all times, allowing the user to finely control the pace at which the video plays for them. To do this, the user simply has to move their mouse cursor up or down while it is inside of the bar and the playback rate will adjust accordingly. A textually-based indicator of the rate of speed is also displayed inside of the bar, providing enhanced feedback and a better UX.
