# Practice with Webcam Filters

This application takes in the user's webcam and grants the ability to control the color filters of the image through the associated range sliders, while displaying an enlarged version of the video feed as a canvas to be manipulated at will. The user also has the ability to create ghost-like after-images, as well as a "green screen" effect, should the proper variables be returned in the script. Additionally the user can take a snapshot of their feed, which gets displayed at the bottom of the screen, and download it if they so choose.

This project was a fascinating endeavor to undertake as I hadn't previously considered how one would go about manipulating a webcam's video feed to create different styles of images. I now understand that the overarching requirement is adjusting pixel output to affect RGB values for coloring and the "Alpha" value for transparency, followed up by tweaking specific elements to achieve varying effects.
