# Searching Locations with AJAX

This simple application allows users to input the name of a city or state and receive a list of all of the cities/states (in the US) that match that search value. At the same time, a count of the total population of each given area is provided. As a user searches for locations, input is not restricted to proper capitalization, allowing for both uppercase and lowercase typing preferences.

The information this application utilizes comes from an extensive JSON file, available for free [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29/raw/2bf258763cdddd704f8ffd3ea9a3e81d25e2c6f6/cities.json).

What I took away from this project was how to match user input with stored data values that were spread into an array, and then display that information in a clear and concise manner.
