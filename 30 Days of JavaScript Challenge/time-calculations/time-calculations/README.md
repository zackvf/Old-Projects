# Practice with Calculating Video Time Lengths

This exercise allowed me to discover a method of converting text strings into numbers and then converting those numbers into amounts of time. This is performed by creating a node list of each video's ```data-time``` attribute, mapping ```parseFloat``` to each item to translate them into usable numbers, and then converting those numbers with basic timing calculations. The total amount of time left to "watch" all of the videos is then logged in the console.
